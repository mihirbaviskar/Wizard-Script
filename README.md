# Wizard-Script
 - wrote code to get in game currency for free(kind of a hack)
 - basically if you do trivia on this link: https://www.freekigames.com/trivia the game will give you in game-currency.
 - not being able to buy the in game currency(I'm poor), I decided to write some code that will do the trivia for me. 
 - so far I have gotten about 10,000 of this in game currency which would have cost me about $20.00 dollars but I got it for free
 How it works?
  - given the database of questions and its corresponding answers the script determines the question and selects the corresponding answer.
   - it was quite simple only took about 1.5 hours but was quite fun
